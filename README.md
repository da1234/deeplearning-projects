### Types of summarisation
    1. Extractive summarisation works by directly extracting the important sentences as it is from the document by using statistic, linguistic, and/or graphical based approaches.
     Abstractive summarisation, on the other hand, uses different models to deduce the crux of the document, and then present a summary consisting of words and phrases that were not there in the actual document.

### Useful resources:
    1. Can try implementing this - https://github.com/rohithreddy024/Text-Summarizer-Pytorch. This combines both 'A Deep Reinforced Model for Abstractive Summarization' and 'Get To The Point: Summarization with Pointer-Generator Networks'
